            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>I am a third-year AI and Machine Learning student at MSRIT with a goal to make a meaningful contribution
            to technology and society. I have interned at Edunet Foundation and Skillible, where I developed skills
            in AI development, cloud computing, and generative models. My projects involve Natural Language
            Processing, IBM Cloud, and advanced machine learning techniques. Beyond academics, I am a Harvard Aspire
            Institute Leadership Program Scholar and actively work on developing leadership and public speaking
            skills
            <br>
            <br>
            I believe in continuous learning, innovation, and using technology to create a positive impact. Whether
            it's teaching my younger brother about innovation or leading a team to deliver successful webinars on
            leadership skills, I am constantly pushing myself to make a difference
